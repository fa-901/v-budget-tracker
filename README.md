# Budget Tracker

A budget tracker built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

This is a remake of a previous app I made with [React](https://github.com/fa-901/budget-tracker).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
